PIZZA SALES SQL QUERIES

A.	KPIâ€™s

1.	Total Revenue:
SELECT SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue FROM pizza_sales





	
2.	Average Order Value:
SELECT SUM(total_price) / COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) as Avg_Order_Value FROM pizza_sales





3.	Total Pizzas Sold:
SELECT SUM(quantity) AS Total_Pizza_Sold FROM pizza_sales






4.	Total Orders:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_orders FROM pizza_sales
  





5.	Average Pizzas Per Order:
SELECT CAST(CAST(SUM(quantity) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) / 
CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Avg_Pizzas_Per_Order FROM pizza_sales













6.	Daily Trend for Total Orders:
SELECT DAYNAME(STR_TO_DATE(order_date, '%m/%d/%Y')) AS order_day, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_orders
FROM pizza_sales
WHERE STR_TO_DATE(order_date, '%m/%d/%Y') IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY DAYNAME(STR_TO_DATE(order_date, '%m/%d/%Y'))








7.	Monthly Trend for Total Orders:
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(STR_TO_DATE(order_date, '%m/%d/%Y'), '%M') AS Month_Name, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_orders
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(STR_TO_DATE(order_date, '%m/%d/%Y'), '%M')
ORDER BY Total_orders DESC











8.	Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category:
SELECT pizza_category, SUM(total_price) as Total_Sales, SUM(total_price) * 100 / (SELECT sum(total_price) from pizza_sales WHERE MONTH(STR_TO_DATE(order_date, '%m/%d/%Y')) = 1) AS PCT
FROM pizza_sales 
WHERE MONTH(STR_TO_DATE(order_date, '%m/%d/%Y')) = 1
GROUP BY pizza_category;
















9.	Percentage of Pizzas Sold by Pizza Size
SELECT pizza_size, SUM(total_price) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) as Total_Sales, CAST(sum(total_price) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) from pizza_sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS PCT
FROM pizza_sales 
GROUP BY pizza_size;








10.	Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity and Total Orders
SELECT pizza_name, SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;








11.	Bottom 5 Pizzas
SELECT pizza_name, SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Revenue ASC
LIMIT 5;








12.	Top 5 Pizzas by Quantity by Orders:
